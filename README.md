# 🧭 p4pilot

### The Perforce-native layer for AI coding agents.

**Auto-checkout · changelist-aware edits · binary-asset guarding · depot code review — over [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).**

Works with **Claude Code**, **Cursor**, and **Codex** — no Git required.

> **✅ Status: MVP complete (v0.1).** Core + MCP server are done and fully
> tested — 46 tests, green in CI, and runnable today with zero Perforce via
> `--mock`. Next up: **Phase 2** (React WebView review panel). Star & watch to
> follow along.

## See it in action

The agent is about to edit two files. p4pilot checks them out first — into the
right changelist — and flags the binary asset **before** it's touched:

```text
$ p4_changelist_create { "description": "player dash tuning" }
Created pending changelist 813: [p4pilot] player dash tuning

$ p4_smart_edit { "paths": ["/depot/game/src/main.cpp", "/depot/game/Content/Hero.uasset"], "changelist": "813" }
Ensured 2 path(s) open for edit:
opened	/depot/game/src/main.cpp [cl 813]
opened	/depot/game/Content/Hero.uasset [cl 813]  ⚠ large-asset — edit carefully (large-asset extension .uasset)

$ p4_status {}
2 open file(s):
edit	//depot/game/src/main.cpp (change 813)
edit	//depot/game/Content/Hero.uasset (change 813)
```

Real output from `npx @p4pilot/mcp-server --mock` — no Perforce required. All 12
tools are documented in [`docs/TOOLS.md`](./docs/TOOLS.md).

## Why this exists

Every mainstream AI coding agent — Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Copilot — is
built for **Git**. It assumes Git primitives: file writes are free, diffs come
from `git diff`, "commit gates" run on hooks, and the repo is mostly text.

**Game studios don't work like that.** They run on **Perforce (P4)**, where:

- A file must be **`p4 edit`-ed (checked out) before you can modify it.** An
  agent that just writes to disk produces changes Perforce can't even see.
- Repos are **huge and full of binary assets** (`.uasset`, `.umap`, `.fbx`,
  `.psd`, `.wav`). These break the file-traversal and indexing heuristics
  agents rely on.
- Work is organized around **changelists**, not commits.

This is a documented, real gap. Anthropic's own large-codebase guidance notes
that native Perforce support only arrived **after a customer built a hook that
intercepted file writes to enforce `p4 edit`.** Until you build that bridge,
"some defaults will not fire."

**p4pilot is that bridge — as a reusable, open-source MCP server.**

## What it does

| Capability | What it means for the agent |
|---|---|
| 🔓 **Smart auto-checkout** | Before the agent edits a file, p4pilot ensures it's `p4 edit`-ed (or `p4 add`-ed if new) into the right changelist. The exact hook studios hand-roll — built in. |
| 🗂️ **Changelist-aware planning** | The agent groups its work into pending changelists with generated descriptions, instead of dumping everything into `default`. |
| 🛡️ **Binary-asset guard** | `.uasset`/`.fbx`/`.psd` and other large binaries are detected and returned as **metadata** (type, size, last change, who touched it) instead of choking the context window with binary bytes. |
| 🔎 **Depot code search** | Fast text search over the synced workspace that automatically skips binary assets. |
| 👀 **Changelist code review** | Turn a pending or shelved changelist into a structured, review-ready diff — "PR review" for Perforce. |
| 🧾 **History & blame** | `filelog`/`describe`-backed history so the agent can answer "who changed this and why". |

All exposed as **MCP tools**, so any MCP client (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex,
JetBrains, …) gets Perforce fluency with zero custom glue. See the full
[tool reference](./docs/TOOLS.md).

## How it compares

| | git-only agents | raw `p4` MCP wrappers | **p4pilot** |
|---|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Works on a Perforce depot | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Auto-checkout before edit** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Binary-asset guarding | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Changelist-aware task planning | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Changelist code review | partial | ❌ | ✅ |
| Zero-setup mock mode for demos/CI | — | rarely | ✅ |

## Quickstart

> Requires Node.js ≥ 20. A real Perforce connection uses your existing
> `P4PORT`/`P4CLIENT`/`P4USER` (or `.p4config`). No Perforce? Use **mock mode**
> below to try everything with an in-memory fake depot.
>
> The `npx` commands assume the package is published to npm. Until then, use
> [Run from source](#run-from-source-until-published-to-npm) — it works today.

### Try it with a fake depot (no Perforce needed)

```bash
npx @p4pilot/mcp-server --mock
```

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add p4pilot -- npx -y @p4pilot/mcp-server
```

### Cursor / other MCP clients (`mcp.json`)

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "p4pilot": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@p4pilot/mcp-server"],
      "env": { "P4PORT": "ssl:perforce.example.com:1666", "P4CLIENT": "my-workspace" }
    }
  }
}
```

### Codex (`~/.codex/config.toml`)

```toml
[mcp_servers.p4pilot]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "@p4pilot/mcp-server"]
```

### Run from source (until published to npm)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sdvgdfvds/p4pilot.git
cd p4pilot
npm install && npm run build
node packages/mcp-server/dist/index.js --mock   # or wire the built binary into your MCP client
```

Ready-to-copy config snippets for each client live in
[`examples/`](./examples).

## Roadmap

- [x] **MVP:** core (runner/parser/client/auto-checkout/asset-guard) + MCP server
- [x] Polish: examples, CI, tool reference & architecture docs
- [ ] **Phase 2:** React WebView panel (changelist dashboard + review UI),
      embeddable in browser / PC client / **UE / Maya** WebViews
- [ ] Shelved-changelist review workflow
- [ ] Asset dependency surfacing (UE `.uasset` references)
